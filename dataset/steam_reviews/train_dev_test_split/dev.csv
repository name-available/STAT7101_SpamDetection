"Review: This game runs like shit on PC. Lets just get that out of the way. That being said this is the most interesting open ended game since oblivion in my opinion.

"Review: The base-game is pretty fun. As someone, who wanted to always try out the souls-series, starting with this game was a pretty good. Had no major hick-ups or gamebreaking bugs until NG+. Some areas have massive visual glitches that make playing ""the dungeon"" impossible (Raya Lucaria or certain caves). Also if I progress through the game reaching certain ""checkpoints"", the game just shuts down. Reloading the game or rebooting the pc does not help for both of the mentioned problems. Besides that, it´s a pretty awesome game, if you have the patience for it., Playtime: 155, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: This is the best survival game I have ever played! If your newer, play with your friends. A lot of bad players do indeed beat a couple good players. Everything you know about the game will indeed be learned by players in game, and YouTube research of the game. Always remember, don`t over-farm before you build your first base, a lot of newbies tend to do this, but the reality is you will keep getting killed with nothing to defend yourself. This drives you away from the game. Instead, constantly craft beds and place them in areas that you would want to build your base, this way, when you do find a location and start farming, there is not as much as a set-back, You can simply spawn at your bed and collect any left-over resources from your body. That is the first of many tips you will hear from a player in rust. Now keep the grind going, Get this game. It is worth it 100%. I have never written a game review before, and this is the first game I have played that has driven me to do so. I LOVE IT! Update: 1300 hours later and I finally learned to beam AK only for Facepunch to update all the recoils. Games High-Key enjoyable now, newer players have a fair advantage., Playtime: 172, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Rust review Graphics All the youtbe videos look great for this game. But version 2 takes a super computer to run. This is the first time Ive ever had trouble running a game.I could even run evolve with no problems. One way they could fix the lag is by makeing a premade map instead of this generated map that lags a lot. Another thing that terable about this game is its rendering. If you take 5 steps back from a tree it turn SUPER blurry. Gameplay Fantastic no complaints Multyplayer Not the best. This game hate people with friends because its next to impossible to play with them. You spen hours trying to find eachother., Playtime: 14, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 27, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: It has flaws, but it definitely does not deserve as much hate as it gets. Yes, it has flawed servers, but it doesn't crash ""EVERY SINGLE GAME!!!!1!!"".

Only problem I had was that I had to create a new Rockstar social club account because the one I was trying to login to was saying the password was wrong.(But thats only a minor problem that wasn't the games fault) 10/10 would recommend this my friend because to me the PC version is a lot better than the console version., Playtime: 86, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 1",1

The game spams you with phone calls that are in-game advertisements for buildings you need to buy, there are hackers in every single lobby, lots of bugs, and the list goes on. I've had dozens of complaints about this game and I've finally gotten sick of it. The story mode and base game is good, but the online experience is shit, plain and simple. Absolute garbage, not worth your time, energy, or money. I find myself left incredibly jaded after finally giving up this game, I hope rockstar can handle multiplayer better in the future, they treat the online almost like you are playing a free to play game. Fuck these guys, I can't bother with this game any longer., Playtime: 339, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 3, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Rust legacy was the perfect game ever made. Unfortunately, Garry’s new vision has clouded his judgment. The new Rust lacks every positive aspect of the old game. It is just a sugar coated, cleaned up b@st@rdization of the Rust brand. All Gary has to do to attain the title of best game creator ever is to do something (anything) about all the cheaters (everyone cheats) on legacy Rust. Gary, scrap the new Rust, realize your mistake, and focus all of your time and attention towards fixing what works: legacy Rust.This game was fun when it was legacy rust, and probably would have been really fun if they kept adding content to legacy rust and fixed some of the memory issues. However Gary decided to go off and do something that made no sense, with no real plan and ruined it completley. So don't buy it. If you do buy it you're pretty much just donating $20 to Garys Lamborghini fund because I have yet to see the millions of dollars in sales put back into making this game good. Everyone lost hope and some idiots on reddit just keep making this game worse with stupid reccomendations that don't help the functionality of the actual game. But hey, you could buy dayz and have 50 ways of opening a can of tuna but also play yet another broken game., Playtime: 709, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 2, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Admittedly I haven't played the game a huge amount quite yet, but from my experience so far hackers haven't been a major issue, despite the huge amount of reviews stating that the game isn't even worth playing because of the hackers. I will say though, that organizing online missions and heists can take a ridiculous amount of time. I recommend playing primarily with people you know, if only to avoid spending 30 minutes trying to find enough people for a heist setup., Playtime: 16, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Terraria is an incredible game that offers endless hours of entertainment and excitement. From the moment you start playing, you'll be transported to a world full of adventure, danger, and wonder. One of the most impressive things about Terraria is the sheer amount of content available. With multiple biomes to explore, hundreds of weapons and items to discover, and numerous bosses to defeat, there's always something new to see and do. And with regular updates adding even more content to the game, you'll never run out of things to explore. Another standout feature of Terraria is its charming pixel art style. The game has a unique and colorful aesthetic that's both nostalgic and modern, making it a joy to look at and play. The music and sound effects are also top-notch, creating an immersive and engaging experience that's hard to resist. But perhaps the best thing about Terraria is its emphasis on creativity and freedom. Whether you want to build a towering castle, explore dark caverns, or engage in epic boss battles, the game allows you to play however you want. With multiplayer options available, you can even team up with friends to tackle challenges together and share in the excitement. Overall, I would highly recommend Terraria to anyone looking for a fun and engaging game that's full of surprises and challenges. It's a true gem in the world of video games, and I can't recommend it enough!, Playtime: 87, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1
