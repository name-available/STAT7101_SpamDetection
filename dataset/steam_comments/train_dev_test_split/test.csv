"Review: I'm not enjoying this anymore. This amazing game has so many flaws it ruined the game for me. It feels like they didnt playtest this, so many little things seems unintended, Torrent not being able to double jump if you fall off a ledge, the bleeding variant of the dogs damaging you every frame, one of the stake of marika straight up not working in one of the side dungeon. At first i was tolerating it, afterall this just is some small nitpicks but boy oh boy,i was not excepting the ""souls jank™"" to be back. Yes the ""souls jank™"" is back; the massive input lag/buffering, the camera doing it's own thing and randomly losing lock on,the fall damage feels random as ever with 2 seconds falls barely damaging you and a 1 second one killing instantly, late game enemies and bosses practically one shotting you in combos, enemy attacks have heavy tracking, i kid you not i've had a bloodhoud sweep do a 90 degree turn up right in the middle of his attack when i jumped. And of top of all that you have loading screen crashes and frame drops oh GOD the FRAME DROPS, granted they seem to have fixed the one in the overworld(?) but they still are here during boss fights. While the open world is fresh and new it still comes with all it's fair share of problems, FROM SOFTWARE fell for some of the open world genre traps, the side dungeons looks all the same, if you pay any amount of attention you will see repeating rooms across different dungeons, this could've been alleviated somewhat had they made more variations of those rooms. The only side dungeon i still remember is the one where instead of having connected rooms you teleport across it via chests . At least the rewards from those dungeons are uniques. Another thing the open world ruins is the balance, past stormveil castle throw away any notion of balance, you'll either be way too underleveled or way too overleveled, you'll go from oneshotting enemies in one area to being oneshot in the next, you'll go from medium enemies giving 500 souls to trash tier mobs giving 1500 souls, hell there's even a spot you can go in less than 30 minutes from the start of the game where all you have to do is lead a ball off a cliff and you'll get a ""meager"" 2000 souls for it, so to compensate for it the damage enemies deal is absolutely overblown, you'll get sneezed on and 60+% of your health is gone, although i'll admit that this could be a result of my build ""only"" having 30 vig as of now. either way you have to choose between a full on tank that does no damage or a glass cannon since this time the stats requirement on the good weapons and spells are upped a ""bit"" (40+ points). The bosses designs(moveset wise) ranges from good fights to ""questionable"" and boy oh boy are some really questionable; Mohg, this boss tilted me enough it convinced me to write this review; being a late game boss he hits hard(to be excepted) he also has dot aoe attack with zero visual feedback that you're being hit by it(except the bleeding bar filling up) and his transition into phase 2, i cannot even begin to comprehend what they were thinking when they made this, get this it's an UNBLOCKABLE, UNAVOIDABLE NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, 3 times attack that does 60% of your health PER HIT, you have to estus 3 times...there's a hp/estus check... on a boss that not only hits hard but also inflicts bleeding... on to the fun ones, margit and godrick were, until i realised you could abuse the posture break and they absolutly got destroyed on my first try, the falling star beast was challenging ,Niall was a good fight since he can summon too, which is a nice break from bosses getting abused by player summons , radahn could've been a fun good fight had the game ran more that 20fps, rennalla first phase is straight up deacon of the deep, rykard was a joke since they give you a weapon that only do wind attacks on him,oh there's bootleg orstein and smough... and the asylum demon... at pretty much every minor erdtree... I'm starting to think FROM SOFTWARE either are creatively bankrupt or a one trick pony. I really wanted to love this game but with all of this combined i just can't. I'll try to finish this game and hopefully the final part will be worth it and i'll have a change of heart. UPDATE: Finally defeated Mohg after completely randomly finding an item that stuns him for 2 seconds (also forgot that his unavoidable attack healed him), i reached Malenia... Mohg is a tutorial boss in comparison, for one Malenia heals on hit you HAVE to dodge, she also has an attack that's basically unavoidable if you're not far away when she decide to use it but hey at least she has no poise so if you even want to have a chance you have to gank her with the mimic. I have to choose between mindlessly grind for hours or skip this boss and feel even more bitter about it or save it for a next playthrough which reminder this is a 50+ hours game, sure i could go for ng+ but if it's anything like the other souls game the enemies stats are gonna get increased which will make it worse UPDATE 2: I'm done i beat the game, i'm glad this is over, after beating malenia the final boss was a joke, a boring waste of time, you'll spend more time running after it, that is after the camera is done sperging out, Playtime: 60, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: While I think the game is fun the developers are very childish. If you read the list of things that can get you banned some of them are very stupid. For example if you honk the in-game car horn too much you can get banned for harrassment. I've seen plenty of videos on YouTube of peoiple getting banned for no reason. The developers need to seriously fix this or I can't seriously reccomend this game to anybody. The game is also extremely poorly optimized and runs like crap on just about any good gaming PC even turning down the graphics doesn't do much at all. It's fun sometimes but because of how the developers handle bans and the games very poor optimization I can't recomend this game., Playtime: 37, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: I'll start by saying that if you're a fan of souls games, you will most likely enjoy Elden Ring, Dark Souls 1 is one of my favorite games, and Elden Ring goes toe to toe with Ds1 in a lot of regards, but can I say that I recommend this to someone starting out in the souls series? No, probably not. Elden Ring is one of the most brutal FromSoft games, and if that's what you're looking for, great! Buy Elden Ring. But if you prefer to have an easier time getting into FromSoft's titles, start with Ds1 or Ds3, both are easier to understand and some aspects of both games will end up helping you in Elden Ring, knowing when to dodge for any of the bosses 300 hit combos that sap your health is a good thing to know. Tl;dr: Elden Ring is amazing but could prove difficult for newcomers to FromSoft titles, try Ds1 or Ds3 first, unless you really want to try Elden Ring., Playtime: 82, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: This is my first ever Souls-like game. Before playing it, I 100% expected to outright hate this game. I thought Souls-like games were just games where being difficult was their entire personality, that's all they had going for them, but man. Man oh man. Man oh man oh man. Man alive. I was wrong. Really my only significant problem I have with this game is that it sometimes crashes out of nowhere with seemingly no rhyme or reason, but tbh this isn't that big of a deal to me. Only other things I can think of that I don't really like is that Elden Ring doesn't have plunging attacks (besides flame chariots, but like... that barely counts lmao), there are no mimic chests (and no, the mist chests don't count. I'm talking about the chests that attack you. The mist chests are more annoying then fun lol, but still not really a big deal at all), and the multiplayer for this game, while abundant, is lacking mechanically. While I don't really mind this since I can just play the Seamless Coop mod, it's still a fault of this game that had to be fixed by a mod. The default multiplayer should have been Seamless Coop This game is LOADED to the BRIM with content. I almost have 700 hours in the game and I'm still finding things/areas that I've never seen before, I still have builds that I want to try, and there are still some bosses that I haven't properly fought (I say properly because I've fought every boss, but that's only thanks to the Randomizer mod, which I don't really count since Randomizer scales up/down bosses based on the location they're randomized to and the area you fight them isn't the intended area). This game is potentially limitless with content, where one of the only possible limits is your imagination 99.99% of the bosses are fun and well balanced (really only boss I can think of off the top of my head that isn't fun or balanced is the double Valiant Gargoyles), and if anyone tells you otherwise, they probably just haven't gotten good at the game. I say this as someone that would always complain about a bunch of bosses... until I got good at them. This might even be the case for the double Valiant Gargoyles, but idk yet because while I'm pretty good at the fight when it's just the first one, when the second one comes in... it's all downhill from there. Bosses that people complain about most are Godskin Duo, Maliketh, and Malenia... but they're all good, fun fights I used to complain about how finding important key items such as the Dectus Medallions was ""poorly made"" because they're almost impossible to find, but that's the game encouraging you to explore, they WANT you to explore. Something a lot of games don't want you to do. And trust me, you're gonna wanna explore this game. I don't even know what I was on, it's not hard at all to find at least one piece of the medallion, and then that piece literally tells you where the second one is. I was simply coping and seething When you first play you might want to go into an easy build that can defeat bosses quickly, but once you get to the point where you play a difficult build, the game becomes so much better. Dying a million times to a boss, but what keeps you going back is that you're learning their moveset. It's like you're progressing the game in a way, and it's such a satisfying feeling when you're accurately dodging and attacking the boss and then you FINALLY get the oh so sweet kill on them. Watching them fall to the ground as they fade away after hours of learning their moves is an extremely good feeling The character creation is one of the best ones I've ever seen. While still not the best out there, it's still extremely exceptional. Really the only thing lacking in it would be more unique hairstyles. All the current styles are either plain or look pretty darn similar to another one. While this is definitely a nitpick, hairstyles are still one of the most important parts of creating a character. Tbh I'm surprised this game hasn't gotten a giant hair pack mod like Skyrim has. This being said, you can still make practically unlimited unique characters, and the customization is very in depth. Especially considering someone made a literal chimpanzee in the character creator and it looks very good lmao [url=[URL] Here's a picture [/url] All in all, this game is a masterpiece. It quickly became my most played game and I see myself playing it years and years down the line as well. It's easily my favorite game of all-time, and probably will be for the foreseeable future I'd give the base game a 10/10, but Elden Ring using the Seamless Coop mod with the homies is priceless, Playtime: 685, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: The devs just want your money and dont care about making the experience a good one. Public lobbies are full of trolls and you are forced to run your business missions in them. Bare in mind you will have done several set up missions to get to the point where you would sell which take a good amount of time (1-2 hours for business cargo for instance) only to be blown up because Rockstar thought it would be a good idea to put a tracker on you. Now the reason I call them trolls is because the payout they get is tiny like a couple thousand $ where they could make a huge amount of cash doing anything else. This game has the potential to be fun, it just seems like the devs are not only uncaring but actively trying to chase away non toxic people.

"Review: How do you even begin to review GTA V in 2023? Almost ten years since its original release on consoles, this game is something entirely different today compared to what it was back then. It's lived long enough to become the villain, though I'm not sure it ever was a hero. I should preface this with the fact that I have played barely a few hours of GTA: Online, and I despised every minute of it. Most of that was long before it has become the main source of income for Rockstar Games, back in the original PS3 release. It's just not my thing, and it wouldn't be even if Shark Cards didn't exist. I'm only saying this to make it clear that I'm really just reviewing GTA V, the single player game. As sad as that makes me, but I can't say I'm a big fan of that either. It's not bad. I enjoyed it enough to 100% it a second time on PC now, but I'm glad it's over and I really hope that Rockstar changes things up with whatever they're doing next. While it's nowhere near as awful as RDR2, the mission design and artificial limitations for the sake of ""realism"" or ""authenticity"" are already beginning to form in the game design here as well. There's still fun parts, though, and the basic premise of just messing around with the sandbox part and not looking so much at the game part also still holds up well enough. When I say ""the game part"", I'm including the story. Ever since GTA went into the third dimension, story has been a major part of the series. With each consecutive game the story became more important, and better. The tragic tale of GTA IV antihero Niko Bellic was (and still is) the darkest and most sincere entry, while maintaining the trademark silliness and biting satire the games are known and loved for. GTA V is worse on all accounts. The protagonists are all 100% jerks, without nuance or complexity. After a while you just kinda accept that you don't really care about any of these asshats. But that's not enough, everyone else is exactly the same. There isn't a single person in this game to truly care for. I suppose that was intentional, maybe a diss against LA, maybe a commentary on today's society. Well, ten year ago's society – I'll be the first to admit that today's society certainly can feel like that sometimes. But it's not like that. Not at all. And I'm not interested in purely cynical takes that do nothing but drag me down. I want some hope and light in the stories I invest time in. Of course it is a noble cause for art to point the finger at problems, but GTA V is not a single painting or just one short song. It's dozens of hours long story, a potentially hundreds of hours long experience. Without any light in it. Don't get me wrong, I can't really fault it for the world it portrays. And I don't need a happy-fun-land that helps me pretend everything in the world is alright. GTA IV's Liberty City was depressing, and the ending of Niko's tale hit me so hard that I basically stopped playing in free-roam because I couldn't take how much of a gut punch that was. And I loved it for that. It made me feel something. There was light in it so that the darkness could overpower it. In GTA V I felt nothing for any of the endings. I was just glad for finally being done with it, for the never-ending darkness to subside. I hadn't really noticed consciously while first completing it in 2013. Similarly to RDR2 a few years later, I just went into the game not even considering the possibility that I might not like it. How could I not, it's the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time – a statement that's true for both series. So in both cases it was only towards the end that I realized… I was still waiting for the good part to begin. On the technical side of things… I'm kind of amazed that even with a pretty top of the line 2021 computer this still isn't able to do a truly stable 60fps on Ultra at 1440p. It's stable enough to not matter with VRR, but still. And apparently this is a good port compared to GTA IV? Will be interesting to see how that replay will go. I bought it shortly after the PC release, some time in 2016, and originally started the second play-through right away. But a mixture of how bad the game performed on my older PC back then and how little I cared for the story and the endless drag of standard mission design quickly made me abandon it. I was about 30 percent in when I picked it back up in early 2023. I do have to commend Rockstar for all the features they've added since – especially the built-in recording and video editor are really impressive. Ultimately, despite how negative this all sounds, I'll go with the thumbs-up here. If you don't care about a story that is congruent and meaningful, there's plenty to like in the game. It is fun to just blast one of your favorite radio stations while cruising along the highway in a stolen super-car. The world and sandbox are worth experiencing, though I'd probably recommend just getting a trainer/mod to change the more annoying (to put it mildly) aspects of the Wanted system, and to be able to elevate the sandbox fun with vehicles and items that Rockstar normally makes exclusive to multiplayer usage.
