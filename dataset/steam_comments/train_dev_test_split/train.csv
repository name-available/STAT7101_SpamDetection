"Review: This game is glitchy as sh!t. It's fun but please for the love of god fix the glitches and slow loading screens. Also make it more optimised for computers. The optimization for this game is sh!ttier than Rust. EDIT 8/22/17 I've encountered numerous hackers that spawn sh!t in. I have no idea how to even hack games so I cant describe how they do it. For example of an encounter, I chased this dude that landed right next to me. (let me clarify. WE JUST SPAWNED) he got away into a small shack. I entered to kill him with a machete. He had a fully decked out AKM along with full armor. He immediately gunned me down. While I sat there in confusion. I asked my friend to try to kill him in which he succeeded with a shotgun. The hacker had a full inventory of decked out sh!t. ALSO The hitboxes are a joke. f#cking fix the hitboxes I hate being killed by a no armor player when I have full armor. It's absolutely broken and ruins the game. Just don't buy it. It's not worth the price. They need to fix things., Playtime: 15, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 4, Votes Funny: 0",1
"Review: This game is all I hoped for and more. I didn't get to play the test but form hearing that this game has an ""easy"" mode I was worried that it wasn't going to be as hard or fun as past titles. Boy was I wrong, this game is hard, unpredictable, rage inducing, its all the things. Minus some performance issues (hopefully a patch soon soon) I'd highly recommend the game. It's bigger than you'd imagine,, Playtime: 20, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: *Overview* In my honest opinion, the game's been going downhill. The streamers have been overhyping it to death, ignoring the real problems with the game. The gunplay is pretty great, but you'll get the same gunplay experience from the Arma series. The community has major problems, including hackers. *More Detail* The real problems with the game are 1. The fact that the game feels extremely repititive when playing solo. This is negated somewhat when playing with friends, as you have people to mess with, but playing by yourself in any of the modes shows the other flaws. 2. The game rewards camping. The circle, while being a good idea to keep players enclosed, makes 3 gameplay types possible/relevant. They are either dying super early in a large city, going to some shitty place to run all game, or just camping for as long as possible. In the community aspect, the developers and community staff are more focused on skins, new weapons that do nothing to change the game, and hosting ridiculous amounts of ""professional tournaments"" for a game that is casual for many reasons, including the fact that practicing a weapon WILL get you killed. Plus, the crybaby streamers can get ANYBODY banned by telling devs that a person who killed them in a game is ""stream sniping."" Onto a more positive note, the gunplay is great. The bullet drop feels accurate, most of the guns handle well, but things like aimduels to test your skills with the gunplay are virtually non-existent. Last note about dev team: they are quite self-righteous: they tried to attack Epic Games for making a Battle Royale game. *Glitches* The glitches in this game are either godawful or downright hilarious. You can either get extreme lag and such, or you could get a glitch where all of the buildings become invisible and allow you to move through them (even with vehicles!). They can REALLY make the game fun if they happen, or destroy the game. *Conclusion* The game has some fun moments, but the community and corporation (yes PUBG corp. is a thing, somehow) are the main destroyers of the game's fun. Also, get this game only if you are going to play with friends. Playing without them makes the game far less enjoyable. If you've made it this far, congratulations! You have made it through my incessant ramblings that took way too long to express through text. Thank you for reading., Playtime: 103, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 1",1
"Review: I've played this game of the course of an entire year, and I'm still not tired of it. This is a great, ridiculous game to get. The community is loving, and loves to trade.

"Review: Game is grindy as hell now. Don't buy it. Before the XP system, there were more playstyles in the game than now. Now it's so linear and you can't branch off and do your own thing. You're literally forced by the devs to follows a strict path that brings you to your destination, which is being able to craft high-end loot. It takes at least 60 hours of farming [ XP gained through farming and destroying barrels and killing animals ] and nothing else that gives you XP like PVP or something else. The devs have this warped view of the game that they think that 80% of their playerbase has time to farm daily to get to a certain level to enjoy it and raid. Primitive weapons have been nerfed and they're useless now. You can't use your SKILL anymore that you've got from the game. You have these artificially created circumstances where a player that farms for 60 hours+ will kill you even if you have 3000 hours in the game, because he took the time to get guns and you didn't. So skill has no meaning in this game. The devs want you to know that. They want this game to be Friendly Farmer Simulator : The Game. This is not what Rust was, is and will never be. People play Rust for PVP, interactions and raiding. And that's it. That's most of the fanbase. If they don't fix the XP system to make it LESS grindy, and revert changes to primitive weapons then this game is on the road to die. Max level needs to be level 20, twice as faster XP gain and all bullets need to be available at level 10. Facepunch won't farm for 60 hours to get max level. They haven't and they won't. Most of the fanbase can kill them in a PVP firefight. So if Facepunch can't or won't farm for 60 hours to get max level for their own game, why should you?, Playtime: 1552, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 15, Votes Funny: 1",1

First, I’d say we need a “Report” button, in where you can report someone for any bad thing they’re doing. That includes, cheating, hacking, or cussing, most importantly. The cussing and amount of toxicity in this game is absolutely ridiculous. People leave and get mad just over not being able to get The Impostor role, and I think that’s silly.

"Review: Game is amazing, but the servers themselves make me want to uninstall this game every time I play, I will constantly disconnect due to server errors and connection errors when I have a solid 12 ping the entire game. When I try to reconnect to Ranked matches, instead of going back to the main menu to rejoin, I have to quit and restart the game for the prompt to rejoin the match to come up. Game is awesome to play with friends, but can get boring if playing by yourself.

Although it can be fairly hard at the beginning, it eventually get easier as you gather more items. My best suggestion is this: Build a house, or a safe structure as soon as possible. Carry torches and glow-sticks. Also download Terrafirma, Tetrameter to view the whole map and give you an idea of where to go, or use both like I do.

But now that it's 1.0 it's still buggy as all hell. they decided right before the full release that they were going to pivote to Xbox. they focused all they're time and recources to that development. i find that very shitty. Also hackers have always been a problem. But now it is even more unbearable. i heard a stat that was like 70 percent of the hackers come from china. why not region lock that country. they have way more than enough to sustain thier own servers. The fact is that most of the hackers are from china, and that they are ruining it for all other people, why should the rest of the player base have to deal with that?

"Review: This is my first FromSoftware game and, let me tell you, it was a treat. I sunk around 60 hours into my first play through, but much of that was guided by the Wiki. Without the wiki, this game would take longer to complete. The world is vast, but not empty. Aside from the bugs, I have a few complaints. THERE IS NO QUESTS TAB. With the amount of quests that can be completed over the course of the story, it is hard to keep track of them. Also, a minimap would have been very helpful. Countless times have I been chased by enemies and not known where I am going. My last complaint: everyone praises FromSoftware's level building; I, however, found much of the world poorly designed in terms of vertical exploration. The trailers mentioned little spots where Torrent (your steed) could leap up or fall down cliffs. In the actual whole of the game, these are underused, making much of exploration or travel a hassle. This leads me into my next point (not complaint). The game is not truly open world. Limgrave, Caelid, and the Weeping Peninsula are all open areas for starting players. Anything beyond that is locked by main bosses (to my knowledge). Sites of Grace are well placed throughout the world though. Over hundreds of deaths later, I am playing through for a second time, and it is far less intimidating. Much of the complaints about this game being too difficult are over-blown. I keep coming back to this analogy. Like spicy food, the flavor is great, but there is always that burn. I 100% believe that thus far, Elden Ring is deserving of GOTY.

What will happen? well you know it.. people who wants to troll/hack, those low life mother fuckers will buy another csgo. guess what.. CSGO Doesn't give a shit as long as they can earn money from it.. i may sound stupid or childish but thats the fact... it's the reality... some people doesn't give a single shit just to get what they want.

"Review: One of the best games of all time to play with friends. I've come back to the game time and time again when it's gotten updated. Terraria has a great feeling of discovery when you play it the first times, and progressing feels great. When you get used to the game more you'll likely form a list of the order you know you want to do things in. There's a good collection of different equipment to choose from throughout the game, not only stat-wise but also for deciding how your character looks. The world is interesting with a wide variety of different biomes with their respective creatures and materials, and if it interests you there are a lot of options for building and decorating structures of your own. The biggest negative about the game is that it gets grindy at points, but a good mindset and some planning easily makes up for it and ends up in a sense of achievement., Playtime: 1029, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Hands-down the best game I've played all year. There are bugs. The game crashes. My computer doesn't handle the memory leak very well, nor does it really hold up to the demands of the game. But it's playable. It's fun. It's amazing. $30 is a bargain. I bought this game last week, and have already played over 30 hours. When I measure entertainment value, I compare it to a trip to the theater, which often costs $5 to $10 per hour, sometimes more if you go for snacks. At that comparison, this is the most financially-responsible $30 I've spent in a long time. It's still early access, and the game continues to improve. With new modes and new maps coming soon, I think it's irresponsible not to buy this game immediately if you are even somewhat interested. Get a microphone, get 3 friends, and go hog wild. I'll be plunking the bats for the foreseeable future., Playtime: 58, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Take all the best parts from the Dark Souls trilogy, throw the formula headfirst into an open world, and the result is Elden Ring. An absolute masterpiece of a game, this game has more flavor and variety than ever seen before. The biggest improvement in Miyazaki's approach is undoubtedly the flexibility the game extends to the player. Almost every basic weapon you pick up throughout your journey can be molded to the fit your build. Want to wield a giant-crushing hammer while casting sorceries? Not a problem, just apply an Ash of War and pick the scaling of your choice. This is most obvious in the game's magic system. The amount of sorceries and incantations flabbergasted me, and after 4 playthroughs, I find myself still experimenting with them. There's just so much variety that the possibilities feel endless. Then, of course, the cherry on top: the art direction. While there is something to be said about the game's somewhat outdated graphical basis, the art direction more than makes up for, and it brings every continent, every nook and cranny, every grotesque abomination, and every castle and city come to life. The legacy dungeons of each area channel previous FromSoft design conventions and elevates them higher than ever before. Full-scale cities are explorable now. No longer are you limited to a single cathedral or path like you were with Anor Londo or Irithyll. From the rooftops to the sewers, how much you discover is only limited to how thorough YOU want to be. So yeah, this game slaps., Playtime: 460, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

I like the triple player design, this really help invlove the player in the story. The story mode is great, this has always been a strong side of GTA. The Story in GTA V holdes its own, I have not yet completede the game so time will tell if the story can hold up to GTA IV and Vice City. The one thing i dislike, is the exclusive addtion to the game. By this I mean that a few missions aswell as some other story elements and vehicles are only avaliable if you have already bought the PS3 og Xbox 360 version, or has bought Speciel editions. None of this is avaliable in any way in the Steam Version. and are a PC Player only., Playtime: 47, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: This is possibly the best FPS I've ever played, tons of gamemodes, maps, weapons, and of course hats. The gameplay is exciting and heavily teamwork based, not to mention that the graphics are so simple yet eyecatching. This isn't your average run-of-the-mill first person shooter, there are nine playable classes each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The game has something for everyone, if you like creating an impenetrable defense you may like to play as the engineer. Like to plow down groups of enemies within seconds? play as the heavy, If you like to sneak behind enemy lines and hunt them down one by one, than the spy is the class for you.

"Review: In 2020, the world was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced people to stay at home and look for new ways to entertain themselves. Among Us, a multiplayer game developed by InnerSloth, quickly became one of the most popular games of the year. The game's simple but addictive gameplay, engaging social interaction, and unique setting made it the best game of 2020. One of the main reasons for Among Us's popularity was its easy-to-learn gameplay. The game is simple enough for anyone to pick up and play, but also has enough depth to keep players engaged for hours. The objective of the game is straightforward: a group of crewmates is tasked with completing various tasks on a spaceship, while a small number of imposters try to sabotage their efforts and kill them off one by one. The gameplay mechanics are easy to understand, and the game's short rounds make it perfect for quick pick-up-and-play sessions. Another key factor that contributed to Among Us's success was its social interaction. The game requires players to work together to complete tasks, but it also allows them to accuse each other of being imposters and vote each other off the ship. This creates a dynamic social experience that is both fun and engaging. Players must use their communication skills to convince others of their innocence or guilt, leading to intense debates and hilarious accusations. The game's unique setting also played a significant role in its popularity. Among Us is set in a sci-fi world where players take on the roles of quirky crewmates and imposters. The game's cute and colorful visuals, combined with its sci-fi elements, create a unique and memorable setting that players can't help but love. In addition to its gameplay and setting, Among Us was also well-received for its accessibility. The game is available on multiple platforms, including PC, mobile devices, and Nintendo Switch. This made it easy for players to pick up and play the game, regardless of their preferred gaming platform. In conclusion, Among Us was the best game of 2020 because of its simple and addictive gameplay, engaging social interaction, unique setting, and accessibility. The game provided an escape for people during a difficult year, and its popularity is a testament to its ability to bring people together through fun and laughter., Playtime: 65, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: By far my favourite game. This game came out in 2013, and although I only started playing it in 2016, I started frequently following this game and watching content about it since 2014. Over the years it has definitely changed for the better, and become increasingly fun to play. With a wide range of server types to play on, different map-types to explore, different game-modes, and different ways to play each wipe in general, this game never gets boring. After 2100 hours I am still having fun and it is not repetitive. I would definitely recommend this game to my friends. This game does, however, have a few issues: -If you play in an experienced group of 3+ people you can easily get end-game gear Day 1 of wipe, potentially making the rest of the wipe boring. -The game is mostly controlled by large clans and zergs, and facepunch has not done much to stop this. -Although the game does not get repetitive, staying on the same server for more than 1-2 weeks does. -Some of the items that have been in the game for ages are now useless or redundant. -You will find yourself always using the same items as there is not much variety in this game. -More could be done in terms of achievements, stats, world-events, and DLC. Ultimately I would very much recommend this game to everyone. The development team releases huge patches and updates monthly, and is likely to fix the above issues soon., Playtime: 2118, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 1",1

"Review: I've owned this game for a little over 96 hours. I've got 20 hours logged at the moment. That should tell you what you need to know, but we also live in a world where idle games exist. Breakdown below. [h1]Summary[/h1] Elden Ring is to Souls what Breath of the Wild was to 3D Zelda. An intermarriage of characteristically-FROMsoft combat and dungeon design, extremely solid art direction inspired by Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and BERSERK with an extremely immersive open world (In the 20 hours I've spent ingame, I literally have never tackled any of the main bosses as I was just exploring.) You can decide to basically pick a direction, and eventually, you'll find SOMETHING interesting. My ADHD-riddled brain has been positively tingling with all the interesting content I've ended up needing to take detours to check out. [h1]Difficulty[/h1] It's also much more approachable than other soulsborne games; while it is still extremely punishing, the room for build variety can really allow you to focus on your strengths and build a viable character. Suck at parrying? Get a decent shield with high poise so you can try the new guard counters instead. Yes, you'll need to learn block timings, but it's a great deal more forgiving than parrying and yet still allows for skilled play to be rewarded. Find the main quest too difficult? Take a detour to any of the various side locations and you'll gain a better feel for the game as well as useful loot and enough runes/souls to get some decent upgrades. Stakes of Marika are basically situational checkpoints that are placed before challenging encounters, and they're an absolute godsend due to how they reduce the amount of times you need to do the ""soulsborne walk of shame"" from the last bonfire to the boss after getting nuked on your first attempt. Summoning Pools allow for an easier way to find co-op partners, and that's a great help as well when it comes to the mini-dungeons, and NPC summons allow for overworld encounters to be approached in multiple ways as well. DEX and FTH builds are more viable than ever due to an expanded range of weapons, most of which can be modded to scale with a certain stat, and an array of unique offensive miracles to complement the other types of magic available in the game. Item usage is also incentivized more due to the new crafting system allowing you to pick up ingredients to prepare for the various situations you'll land yourself in, rather than items being bound strictly to discovery and shopping, which would make them harder to use if you're a hoarder like me. All of these things said, the game is also extremely challenging and forces you to learn its systems if you want to enjoy the title, like all other FROMsoft games. [h1]Art and Sound Design[/h1] This is by and large the prettiest game I've played in the last few years, and that's primarily due to its seriously well done art direction rather than a surplus of expensive next-gen rendering tricks. While the text has a very somber tone, the world design is vivid. Elden Ring does not shy away from using a rich color palette to convey its world. And of course, it's a game rife with environmental storytelling, from mob and prop placements to a strong sense of consistent architectural design. As mentioned earlier, this game does borrow a lot of its tone and art-style from the great late Kentaro Miura's work on BERSERK. While being choc-full of details and eye-candy, the game does an excellent job of conveying a stark, somber world without resorting to overusing sepia tones or the dreaded shit-brown of 2008 gaming. The art is also extremely thematically consistent with the narrative, and it feels like whoever was in charge of directing the gfx work definitely had their finger on the pulse of things when it came to keeping things in line with the mood that the world builds on. As usual, FROM's monster designs pull from a lot of different archetypes and aesthetics, and offer an absolutely fascinating roster of baddies to fight, an experience that's elevated way more by the fact that this game has the most amount of songs in the soulsborne franchise, including several tracks that change dynamically based on your interactions with the world. The already weighty and satisfying visuals of the combat are rendered all the more engaging by the excellent foley work done as well. [H1]Performance[/H1] As for the current performance issues, I won't deny that they exist; that said, my 3060TI is handling things just fine, with just the occasional microstutter when rendering new effects for the first time due to it being a DX12 title. In the meantime, expanding your shader cache through nVidia control panel seems to alleviate things a great deal. They have NOT significantly affected my play experience, but that's my personal experience and your mileage may vary due to your tolerance. That said, I do feel like these concerns are *slightly* overblown by some in the community, as the game by and large runs very smoothly for me at around 40-55FPS at 1440p with a mix of max settings and high quality grass, with an easily-attainable flat 60 if I decided to switch things to all high or medium instead. You'll be just fine if you've got a 1080p monitor and an average graphics card, and it can definitely be scaled down further to lighter builds, though I wouldn't try it with something like a 6-year old laptop 960M. As I don't remember there being a ton of reports of the stuttering during the network tests, I believe that it's something fixable, and FROM has issued a statement mentioning that they will be working on it. Honestly, just try the game out, see how it works for yourself, and refund it if you're unhappy., Playtime: 19, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

More stragetic and fun while playing with friends.

"Review: Though GTA 5 SP and GTA Online have their flaws here and there(mostly in Online), if you buying this game just for Online, I'm gonna tell you that you should watch out for modders. Even though there aren't that many anymore after the new anti-cheat system they have, there still are some here and there. BUT. If your buying it for SP... That's one of the best choices you'll make. I bought this game in February and I still play this game every day. Yes i may have a little over 100 mods (including car mods) in SP, but that doesn't give the game all the fun. If your mind can bring you beyond in imagination in doing things like driving your car off the top of Maze Bank and trying to land on peds, to getting drunk with Trevor or Franklin and driving drunk while getting chased by the cops and shotting them?

"Review: To borrow from Borderlands 3: ""You. Will. Die. (over and over.) - The Game"". But, you will also learn, become stronger, and beat this game. Elden ring is not easy by any means, but it is also doable. And when you overcome that challenge (Yes, I'm looking at you, || Margit ||...), you feel a sense of satisfaction that you did it.

"Review: A very fun game as long as you have a group of at least 6 people (preferably people you know) to have games of a decent length. The gameplay is relatively simple, but the social aspect is what makes it such a good time. Unfortunately, the servers can be quite problematic, sometimes frequently giving people connection errors when others have no trouble. It's never outright prevented any of my group from playing, but it has sometimes delayed our sessions for a while as we try to fix it., Playtime: 4, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1
"Review: This game is one of the best games on the market. If you like to play sandbox games where you can spawn anything, kill anything, and drive anything this game is for you. There are over one hundred thousand addon's. The possibilities are pretty much endless. It brings back many childhood memories of playing this game almost daily. It brought so much glee. Having over 400 hours on this game I still haven't done everything I've wanted to. It is very fun with friends aswell! Many Youtuber's have also played this game (ex. Markiplier, VanossGaming. Whitt), They also think this game is very fun. There are many ideas on what to do in this game out on Youtube and many other social media platforms. There is a reason why the user reviews are ""Overwhelmingly Positive"".

"Review: A few years ago, my good friend gifted me dark souls 3. he wanted me to play it because he enjoyed it so much. I got past the first boss, Iudex Gundyr, after a bajillion deaths, and I stopped playing shortly after. I didn't get the appeal, and didn't appreciate the difficult, but surmountable challenge. I recently finished God of War, 100%, and my favorite part of that game were the valkyrie fights. They were so hard, but it felt so good when I finally defeated them one by one. That experience made it click with me. It was hard, but not impossible. Learn your enemy, anticipate their moves, wait for an opening and attack. And feel the joy of overcoming a challenge. This game, Elden ring, gives me a constant flow of that feeling, and I love it. Aside from the challenge, the world is beautifully crafted; the art and lore are amazing.The game is incredibly big too, endless content. I’m 150 hours in and I still have a lot more to go. So good! It’s in the top 5 best games I’ve ever played. Can’t wait to jump back into darksouls after I’m finished with this., Playtime: 152, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

Because I was busy playing online. But this year I promised myself to finish the story mode once and for all. TBH the story ain't that bad. It's goofy, interesting, meaningful, HELLA ENJOYABLE. What else do you want from a game? Especially THE GAMEPLAY WAS/IS DOPE. Even if you don't like the story you will love the gameplay. I mean it's a GTA entry what else do you even spect? The story mode has a great amount of mission, the city feels lived in. I mean it's made by rockstar. Obviously, the game is one of the best open-world games out there. Los Santos city was built SUPERBLY. Hats of to Rockstar they did a great job recreating Los Angeles which the city is based on. Los Santos isn't cheap, HEIST IS ETERNAL. The ending missions were superb enjoyed those missions a lot. The story wasn't a masterpiece or GREAT it's just good, sometime good is better than complex/over the head or HISTORIAN STORY. [Yes Ubisoft I am saying about you]. Sometimes all you need is a GOOD TIME and nothing to worry about. THE STORY MODE HAS NO BUGS BUT ONLINE? FREAKING YES greedy Rockstar milking this since birth. Over I do say the online is better and more enjoyable than the story but YEA it's worth the shot. The game has multiple contents that will take around 100ish hours to complete.

"Review: It's a fun game, and it has a lot of potential, but the netcode is garbage. Half the time bullets don't even come close to hitting near the crosshair even at close range. Also, BlueHole has already implemented microtransactions which they claimed they wouldn't do. While they are only cosmetic, knowing BlueHole can and will go against their word leaves me no choice but to worry about what they may decide to do in the future. If you're not worried about the political side of game development and just want to play, go for it. PUBG isn't the most optimized of games, but it can run on a fair selection of hardware configurations given that you aren't afraid to turn a few settings down. The inclusion of First-Person only servers does an excellent job at keeping the game fresh while giving you a more realistic sense of terror as you scavenge for weapons and search for shelter. Overall, I'd say this game is worth your consideration, but think hard about whether or not this game is for you.

"Review: Grand Theft Auto 5 is a thrilling andrenaline pumping game you can go into insane hiests or pull off the biggest KOS streak ever. Points: Map~ The map is very big for a exciting online adventure. Cars/vehicles~ There is over 300 vehicles of different brands, ranging from Hypercars to cold war Fighter crafts and soviet bombers like the Tu-160 Blackjack. Players~ Players/friends are fun to play with you can also betray their trust and blow them or their cars up. Problems~ 1/15 of the player base is cheaters using 'mods' to exploit the game and ruin ur fun experience playing Rockstars hit game. I personaly love playing this game with ym friends and exploring the landscape, like with almost every other game Rockstar has made it has emersive whats-coming next Lore and Perfect story and quests, Playtime: 18, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

I think the only thing holding this game back from a solid 10/10 is the performance. The stuttering can be pretty bad at times, and i experienced a handful of crashes (not a big deal as these games save very often). The other souls games ran smooth as butter. I've beaten the game twice, and i'm thinking of starting yet another character. the game had high expectations, and From delivered, which is rare these days., Playtime: 107, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: PUBG is a battle royale game which focuses more on realism and tactics than arcadish BR games like Fortnite and Realm Royale. You parachute down on an island with 99 other players where you have to scavenge and kill to be the last man standing. You can play solo or with friends. I personally recommend playing with friends because you get a lot more action. It's really hard to enjoy this game. When it works, it's fantastic, a unique and fun gaming experience. But when it doesn't, it just really kills the experience and makes me wanna regret the time and money I've spent on PUBG. Don't get me wrong, I loved this game early on (before 1.0 ), but after launch it got filled with more mtx and performance got worse. The focus on mtx isn't my biggest concern, since they are optional for the players and doesn't really slow down other aspects of game development. What I think ruined the game for me was all the promises and slow development. I've had fps lag and stutter since beta where some patches made it better and some worse. I really love the gameplay and the gun play is tight. Winning games were really satisfying and fire fights were always exciting and chaotic, but playing with desync and bad servers ain't fun. It ain't smooth to play and that ruins my experience. A real shame, how this game has been managed since it's the best tactical BR on the market right now. Hopefully they will sort things out. I have high hopes for this game but right now I can't recommend this game., Playtime: 262, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 2, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: GTA 5's singleplayer is an amazing experience that I say everyone should experience, but online is a fun hellhole. With modders on the loose and new exploits and bugs being found by the day due to the massive community the chances of you having a decent public session are very slim, most sessions I have there are modders giving money drops or just blowing everyone up or spawning in cars to lag people's games or even somehow crashing people's games, it's not enjoyable. Currently the economy of GTA:O is in shambles also as most things now players can't even buy after long grind sessions and even if they manage to spend their money right and become a CEO and farm import export the chances that they just get blown up by a griefer in a scramjet or Oppressor MK2 are seriously high and Rockstar doesn't seem to do anything to fix it. Even though the game gets very regular content updates and new free DLC fairly often it's hard to enjoy the new amazing content when there is just people who can completely destroy the game for you, so unless Rockstar manages to fix these exploits or put in a better anticheat to get rid of modders and to try and add a system that at least doesn't allow griefers to mess with player's cargo and stuff as easily then I wouldn't recommend it for just the online, for the singleplayer though it's truly a worth price tag of 30 dollars., Playtime: 376, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: I know I know first you look at my playtime and your hand is instantly itching to be salty at me in 175 words per minute, yet I will review this game. I am an intelectual. I don't get amused easily. I watch Rick & Morty. In such a short time I already reached such marvelous achievements. Just some of them are: WOW! - Couldn't kill a guy from behind. or perhaps one I am rather proud of : youraknoob - Get trashed on by everyone in a match. Now this is out of the way. I will talk about something what I call G&G - Gameplay and Graphics. Game looks simply amazing I played at stable 60 fps in menu and somewhat around that amount in lobby. Let's move on Gameplay - This is aspect of a game I find to be very unimportant. I don't the balance thing at all. Why balance someone, make two characters OP so I can play with them every single match. Other than that shooting is very unintuitive I find shooting with Mouse 1 very difficult at times, mostly when I can't find my wireless mouse so I play on TouchPad and there is no Mouse 1 so I just walk around.

"Review: Glad to see Take Two doesn't give a shit about it's customers. I bought this game on the Xbox360 and Xbox One when the both came out, and I also anxiously waited for the PC release. While waiting for the PC release, I beat the story mode on both consoles and thoroghly enjoyed the game both times. Yeah the game had it's fair share of issues with multiplayer when first released, but that was to be expected from such a highly anticipated release. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and decenrlt captivating. For a little while. Eventually you run out of things to buy in singleplayer, so you start playing multiplayer by yourself and with your friends. Here you realise that you don't have enough money to buy anything to run any businesses in game, nor do you have enough money to buy weapons and ammo for the missions. How do you overcome this? MICROTRANSACTIONS OF COURSE!! Finally, like me, you get fed up with the modders, cheaters, lack of depth of new content, and shitty microtransactions, that you start modding singleplayer to add new elements in game and basically make the game better than when it was initially released. HA! YOU THOUGHT! Fuck you Take Two for releasing shite content and all but forcing players to buy cards that give them in game currency to use it. Fuck you Take Two for not allowing modding anymore.

"Review: I am a big souls fan so i am not going to talk much about any of the positives because all the positive things which apply to the other souls games apply to this game aswell, so i am only going to mention the things which i didnt like. To sum up the positives real quick: its a fucking souls game, cool gear, badass bosses, great soundtrack, nice scenery, interesting lore. negatives: - Because its so open world its easy to miss content which becomes ridiculously easy once you find it later on - Playing a melee build made me feel forced to spam the jumping attack, as its just way better in most scenarious, especially in boss fights using a big weapon - It is abso-fucking-lutely impossible to follow NPC questlines in this game, i found several interesting npcs throughout my playthrough which i met once in a while just to never see them again and completely miss out on their story and items they reward, the devs for some reason expect you to find the exact pinpoint location of every npc every time you advance their story on this giant ass map on a specific timeline of the story and if you miss your opportunity to talk to this npc at that one location its over, npc is gone forever... - There are a few absurdly strong ashes of war effects which are not even comparable to most other moves and trivialize large portions of the game (bloodhound step, hoarfrost stomp come to mind) - I really dont want to sound like an elitist jerk but i personally thought the game overall especially the early content was too easy. Sure there is a boss at the end that i would consider the hardest souls boss ever but that unfortunately doesnt make up for the snorefest which was the first 80% of the game. The game offers so many extra tools which new players can use to ease their experience, why make most of the game so easy for experienced players., Playtime: 187, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Company has total sellout practices which affects the game in many ways. Both in development and in features. Console release being the latest one to affect such, but not forgetting past events either(like the chinese ad issue&microtransactions). Development has been slow lately due console release and bugs still varied in countless ways. SSD being one of requirements to make game playable(yet not listed so in official requirements list). Even free beta testing from players doesn't help them to remove the bugs and warping. Not to mention cheaters. This game is a big hit though, and 1.0 will probably bring last patch of huge influx of new players in to the game. Therefore fun time for new players to still enjoy the game. I still wouldn't recommend this game though unless you are a hardcore fan of the series and can't get enough of it elsewhere.

"Review: THIS IS A POST-COMPLETION REVIEW. THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THERE ARE SPOILERS, BUT IT IS A POSSIBILITY. After a half-completion playthrough (that was abandoned) and then another that went all the way to the end, I can safely say that the first 3/4s of this game are easily the magnum opus of FromSoft. This doesn't need rehashing given how much universal praise there is, but I figured I'd mention it too. As you get near the end, though, some issues begin to make themselves more known. I will be focusing on those issues, not because this game isn't incredible (it is), but because I wish to see those issues talked about and potentially solved. Anyhow: One issue I've noticed is rolling causing you to be open to multiple damage instances, resulting in attacks from some bosses (ground based attacks) to hit you multiple times and instantly kill you. A simpler example of this is when you roll inside a status effect pool (ie: crimson rot water). You will begin to take doubled-up ticks of the status effect, the second tick continuing on you even if you leave the pool. A second issue is the odd damage balance for weapons. I've heard reports from friends that some of the scaling mechanics on weapons straight up do not work, leaving them cripplingly underpowered compared to others. Although I cannot verify this, I can verify that the weapons have weird damage values, so scaling issues are not impossible. My INT-based katana consistently hitting harder than my buffed up Legendary INT greatsword - despite both being at +9 - was the example I personally ran into. On that same note, scaling is all over the place and seemingly far lower than it was in previous games. I did not see a single 'weapon' (excluding catalysts) that started with higher than C scaling in any one stat, making the conversion mechanics to gain faith/int/arcane scaling terrible. It also seemed that scaling grew less throughout leveling, meaning unless you empowered a specific stat on a weapon, their scaling was nearly useless. Even at +16 (not highest, I know) the estoc with magic scaling had a C to dex scaling and a C to INT scaling, far less than you would want out of a mageblade. Maybe this is just my personal ability to miss every good item/relevant item to my build, but it feels strange to encounter, especially as you get deeper and deeper into the game, where every damage point means more and more. On a quick note of 'deeper and deeper into the game', this game has some truly incredulous enemy damage scaling. Even at 35%+ phys resistance and potentially 40%+ affinity (element) resistances, I was consistently getting chunked for half or more of my hp from attacks, with regular mobs hitting for a little less than a quarter semi-reliably. I note that this was with 40 vigor, which means 1450 hp. I ended up pushing vigor to 40 and wearing double resistance rings just to not get annihilated whenever someone looked at me funny. Oh, poise, too. I am legitimately unsure if poise exists. We all know (those that played it) that DkS3 had no poise to speak of, the mechanic <literally disabled> in favor of a hyper-armor esque mechanic when you were attacking. Elden Ring does SAY that poise does things - in loading screens and such - but I've yet to take an attack and not get staggered. Perhaps I just wasn't stacking heavy enough plate armor, but given I was wearing near-max-weight armor, I'd say there is something weird going on once again. Overall, this is a masterpiece of a game that manages to keep the seams from splitting until the very end, a feat few other games I have ever played have managed. Easily as good as reviewers said it was, and easily one of the best examples of the game living up to the hype. Play it. Just play it. I will try to update this review more as I play more and more of the game (or it gets updated)., Playtime: 89, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 0, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: Updated Review at 40 hours. Overall opinion after 40 hours, Game is amazing and extremely addictive. It's like you took Dark Souls 3 and chopped it up and spread it around a giant world then filled in the spaces with horse exploration and battles with mounted knights, giants, and dragons. But its not perfect, I guess nothing can be. A Note on Difficulty. The game is about as hard as Dark Souls 3. And it seems to be ramping up more and more as I get deeper into the game. These little side caves and getting more devious. These overworld enemies are starting to really be dangerous. I would say Limgrave is the easiest souls starting area, but once you stretch out a bit the pressure will begin to mount. The Good Let me take a moment to evaluate why I like this open world structure by bringing up my favorite open world game before this game, Marrowind. Now marrowind's ingame map was pretty useless but you had a hand drawn map that had all the locations with names etc. and people would say, ""Go find a cave north of this spot"" and you'd find it on your map and go out and manually hunt for it. This ended in Skyrim with the inclusion of quest markers. You could literally just go in a direction toward that marked point and the fast travel from then onwards. What I liked about Marrowind was using that crappy hand drawn map and going out and exploring felt more like exploration. In elden ring we get a hand drawn map, and no quest markers. You get grace markers that point you in a direction but honestly they aren't needed cause they point you to like the most obvious giant ass castle that you can see from any point on the map, its like no shit of course I need to go to that massive feature at some point. But outside of that there is no quest markers, instead you look at your little nicely drawn map and see little castles, trees, churches, canyons, and then set out to see what their all about on your own. Generally each one these is filled with monsters, treasure, and npcs. That's basically the loop, find the map in each empty area which plants you in the middle of it, then use the map to go to each little point of interest and do dark souls stuff. Also the open world is less open than you might assume. Its not Botw, you can't just run in a direction and climb over mountains until you hit the edge of the map. The world map is more broken down into a series of thinner spaces that lead to point of interest so you can sort of say I'm gonna go down this peninsula and hit all the stuff on the way which makes each off shoot a level of sorts. This goes against the old open world structure which was ""find the town, and get quests which send you out into the world"" This new system is much more organic because you are going out and going to these places on your own volition. The enemy and boss design is fantastic. Lots of very cool and interesting enemies fill every location. It never gets stale. There must be at least 200 enemies types in this game. Loads of unique treasure for each system that you will need so it makes doing to each little point of interest worth your time cause it might just have a flask upgrade, a spell slot upgrade, a wondrous flask upgrade, a new ashe of war, a new weapon, a new armor, a key/quest item, weapon upgrade materials, a spells, a shop unlock item, a crafting recipe book, or lord knows what other thing that is unique and permanent. You see a little camp of soldiers, and you are going in cause its going to have a goodie. And not some consumable short lives goodies like botw, but a piece of permanent unique gear that interacts meaningful with the game's myriad of systems. The horse, oh the horse. Man they really did a good job on the horse. It controls beautifully and the horse combat adds a new type of combat to the souls genre. So not only do you have good souls on foot combat now you have this new combat type. And the game throws battles at you that demand you use this new feature. Now dragon fights are epic slogs over massive landscapes, you dance around mounted foes who will cut you down in 2 shots. Nothing like this has been in any game ever. When I saw the trailers, I said oh shit I get to fight a dragon that summons lightning from the sky on a double jumping horse and boy did it deliver. Also its dark souls. And the dark souls bits are as good as ever, incredible level design, really cool encounters and use of space, loads of secrets, and traps. Stormveil castle is one of the best souls levels of all time. There was one side level where i had the fight this mage as she kept teleporting up a tower, summoning foes along the way. Just loads of good stuff. The Bad. The PC port has issues. Not acceptable ones. And yes they are patching it but it I've had patches make things worse and better. Frame stutters, pauses, server outages, failed summons, and crashes every 4-5 hours. Nothing game breaking but enough to ""tarnish"" and other wise amazing experience. If you have a PS5 or XBOS Series X, get it on those platforms. The little mini dungeon bosses are hot trash and shouldn't have even been in the game at all. Its a bizarre design choice. With so much rich variety in the huge overworld why am I fighting the 4th version of the stupid statue cat/dog boss? And this sort of is aggravated by all that good unique loot cause a lot of times you really need to finish these things cause they often have very useful items. Let give an example. There are mines in the games. They are filled with weapon upgrade resources so you are going in the those damn mines. But they have a trash boss at the end. Its usually just a slightly harder version of an enemy you'd already fought so its not a hindrance. But still the whole affair comes off as lazy when they already have so much amazing stuff, why plop these little turds along the way. Also sometimes these side dungeons are actually big cool dungeons with cool bosses, and its never clear so you are going in all of them. The horse randomly unsummons its ass mid fight. Now I have the horse on the Y plus direction fast option so there is no way i'm pressing unsummon mid fight. But randomly for reasons I'm not totally sure my horse just unsummons in some pretty damned inopportune moments. Like say when i'm about to get my face smashed in by a huge ass monster and that horse was my way to avoid such a grim fate. So those are my thoughts on Elden Ring thus far. I'll talk again after I beat it in 200+ hours., Playtime: 5, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1

While the game lacks a focus or goal, and that may put off some people, you make your own focus or goal, and that's what makes this game special.

"Review: This game is a comical dumpster fire. Almost EVERYTHING is done clientside, so cheating is rampant and impossible to stop. Cars will randomly launch you across the map and explode. When driving you will hit random invisible walls in the terrain which will most likely kill you. Desync is common, and you'll get randomly killed even when you ar eunder cover because the server insists that you are standing still in a field 100 meters away. Just... save your money.

"Review: One of the greatest games I’ve ever played is Rust. The game’s developers frequently update it and add new features. Bug fixes can take some time, but I don’t mind.

"Review: About time i posted a review , i have played over 300 hours of Pubg and have to admit i love this game , everyone saying the game need to be optimized well it all depends on your spec and gfx card, i use to play this game with 80fps on low/med settings with a gtx 770 without minor issues , i have since upgraded to a gtx 1070ti and i am running at 144fps without issues , yes the game could do with a bit more optimizing and hopfully they will work on that. The main issue on this game is the amount of cheaters that lock on head shot you with guns without even scopes for far , now i know you are hard at work trying to make this game good and adding more guns and maps but maybe focus a little more on the cheaters , if you don't start getting rid of them your game will die over time. Also my next issue is the items we have in our inventorys not allowing us to trade them to mates , the items are ours to do as we wish as we have paid for them with our own money, a revert back to allowing us to trade would be great inless you are going teh same way as CSGO is then you will lose over 150k players in a few weeks. Apart from the above and a few things needing to be fixed , i do recommend this game , its fun , and team based game with mates and i love it., Playtime: 342, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 3, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: So, I don't really know where to start when I am about to talk about this game. I bought this game in early 2015 and I still play it until this day. I got it for the same price as it's sold for today. Which is a pretty good deal to be honest. When I first started playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive I found the game really hard to play and understand, since I came from the Call of Duty community. I had just bought a gaming computer so I had to get used to using a keyboard and a mouse instead of a controller, which was pretty hard for me. This resulted in me not being the greatest at controlling my spray control and movement, so I actually ended up in Silver 1 as my first rank. When I was Silver 1 other players used to laugh at my rank because they said things like ""You suck noob, you'll never get good"" and overall degrading comments about my rank. This motivated me to get better at the game, every day I looked at videos on YouTube on ""How to get better at CS:GO"" and ""How to get out of silver hell"". These videos really made me improve at the game, I learned basic things like crosshair placement, movement and smoke executes. Knowing these small things and having them in the back of my head while playing the game, made me improve as a player. I started climbing on the ranks, and all of a sudden I had reached Legendary Eagle just within 144 competitive wins. In Legendary Eagle I got more accepted in the Counter Strike community itself. I am quite sure it's because up in the higher ranks people actually want to win and do their best, instead of laughing or screaming at me calling me a tryhard or to curse at me in russian or any other foreign language. However, in Legendary Eagle aka LE people actually had real skill. Using my 60Hz monitor no longer worked becuase other players using a 144Hz monitor would spot me before I could react and shoot at them. So I decided to invest my money in a 144Hz monitor, since I really wanted to reach The Global Elite. At christmas, when I recived my money I bought a 144Hz monitor from Benq (BenQ XL2411Z). It worked perfectly fine and you even had settings so you could change the vibrance of your colors and much more. I could simply adjust the settings to my prefrences. For example, I could make darker spots a lot more brighter giving me an advantage in fire fights in dark areas such as in the Apartments on De_Inferno. After wasting around 2500 hours on the game and having approximately 350 competitive wins I had finally reached The Global Elite rank. What I really love about this game is that you don't need to waste any money on it to get any sort of advantage in Valve's official servers. You simply pay the thirteen euros for the game and you're good to go! I also like the whole concept of the game, it's such a simple game but also such skill based. All the small details of how you play the game and what sort of decisions you make in the game is game changing. And if you do like to collect in-game items, either expensive or cheap items the Counter Strike: Global Offensive market is completly perfect for you. The trading community is really big and there are even special Community servers and websites where you can find people to trade with. There is no other game out there with a more encouraged community when it comes to giving tips and tricks on how to improve the game and how to get better as an individual player. But, there is one problem. I am sorry to say it, but this game has one of the worst developers in the world. They simply don't listen to the community, they're just out for the money. This game also has one of the worst anti-cheat systems out there, every non-prime match making game you play there will always the that one cheater that's ready to spinbotted if it's needed, which really ruins the whole point of the game and even trying because you know you'll lose even what you do. The players in the ranked matches are also really toxic and it's very common to be cursed at in foreign languages such as in Russian or Polish. Valve's official servers, simply the ones you play ranked matches on do run in 64 tickrate which isn't good because sometimes the hits doesn't register on the server. Like honestly, c'mon Valve. You're a million dollar company and you can't even listen to the community or invest in 128 tickrate servers? It's sad to see a great and wonderful game that could actually stay in the Esports scene for a long time, slowly and steady die. But instead of fixing these problems the developers just sit and milk out money from the players by releasing new cases, operations and other things that cost a lot of money. Even thought these items doens't affect the gameplay, they do manipulate the market prices making them earn a lot of money. Not really that Valve would care, but honestly. Please fix your game and start listening to the community or they won't stay and they'll move to another game just like what happened with the Call of Duty community. EDIT: Worst fucking game ever with the worst developers to ever exist. I have put so much effort, money, time, blood, sweat and tears in to this game hoping that Valve would start caring and actually fix their game. But they don't. Almost every game you play you play against some sort of cheater. Other games have issues with cheaters aswell, but not as much as Counter-Strike has. VAC is honestly a joke. I am done with this cancerous game. Good thing Valorant has been released. Riot Games, the developers of Valorant actually care about their game, compared to Valve that don't give a damn. That's my new game. Fix your shitty Anti-cheat, implement 128 tickrate servers and release Source Engine 2 and I might consider playing this game again.

"Review: With almost 1300 hours of gameplay in pubg and hundreds of wins I have to say that this use to be a good game. Sure there were always bugs that the developers had known about for a very long time that were never fixed(some even as far back as launch). But this game was fun. Honestly, at this point the group of people I play with in discord have already started playing other games. It's not like we were bored of the game or even wanted to start playing other games but when the developers can't get hacking under control in this game there is no sense playing. There are 3-4 groups of hackers every game in squad games and the leaderboards are loaded with these guys for sometimes weeks at a time. They can not get rid of the hackers and keep them gone. So if you decide to play this unoptimized, hack-fest of a game, just expect to be at a disadvantage and sprayed down across the map, through mountains and buildings, by enemies that have the ability to fire quicker than you can, that have no recoil, that can instaheal, and know where you are at all times due to wallhacks. I suggest you carry every single grenade that you can because you will need them to win most games against cheaters. My squad use to get 6-7 wins in an evening and now we are lucky if we get 1 every couple days. I have to say though that since we started playing other team based games together, I havent really missed this game at all. It's left a very bad taste in my mouth and I doubt we will ever give this game a serious go again. Edit: I also want to point out another issue that has made this game flawed. Typical games start with 90-100 people in the plane. After the first circle closes there is usually 25-35 people left for another 7 circles. So if you don't ""hot drop"" (drop to a major city where people are known to go for good loot), the you will most definitely have a very boring game. We have had times where we jump Yasnaya(one of the bigger cities) and by the time we loot up and leave to go fight people there are 20 players left and it's usually one of the multiple hacker groups that we end up seeing when we finally find people. Honestly, hot dropping to school and military base on Erangal or Pecado, Hacienda, and Los Leones and hoping to have fun if you are able to find and fight players without hacks early game is probably the most fun way to play this game anymore. Atleast you can get some kills and move on to the next match once you die instead of dropping and spending 25 minutes looting up with minimal battles because the mid-game fights are basically non-existent and then ultimately dying to some cheater in the late game., Playtime: 1274, Voted Up: False, Upvotes: 2, Votes Funny: 0",1

"Review: GTA:Online Portion of this game has been ridden with cheaters since the start. Because the game uses a system called Peer-to-Peer it isn't really possible to have a good anti-cheat because of how P2P works. Rockstar went with this system to save themselves money on dedicated servers, and ultimately the integrity of their playerbase's online experience. There is quite a lot of fun to be had online, assuming you don't run into griefers or cheaters. However, there is quite a bit of grinding involved to partake in the fun adventures of GTA:Online, for every million you make you need at least 2-4 hours of grinding for (With CEO/VIP/I/E). Some players might be turned off by the grinding in GTA Online others might not, it all depends on you - the player. There have been sort of paywalls or grind walls for non-sharkcard players. Like Yachts for example are 8-12mil so that's roughly $100-150 USD for that yacht. Or 20+ hours of grinding. Rockstar's latest paywall was the recent update Gunrunners where you must pay 225k per research if you want it fast ot wait 4 hours + per research while resupplying the bunker (and not getting any RP or $ for doing it). Whereas CEO work would pay you for securing things. If you buy all the research it's just shy of $225 USD worth of shark cards. Or if you wait it out roughly 400 hours + of playing GTA Online while babysitting your bunker. Not including the new pegasus military vehicles added which while offering a discount, are still expensive. 35 mil to purchase and upgrade them (customization will raise you another 8+). So in the end if you want the 'full' experience of this update you need at least 50million or $500-600 USD of shark cards, and the time needed to get that money in-game would be 200-400 hours. Unless you run into a cheater giving cash, which rockstar has some countermeasures for (with varying accuracy). Some people got all their money taken away while only having 5mil others had 300-500mil cheated money but never had it touched. Singleplayer The singleplayer portion of this game isn't bad, but it isn't technically supported. Any of the content made in GTA Online isn't added into singleplayer because they won't get your shark card money that way. With the recent events of them shutting down OpenIV (Which is for singleplayer modding NOT online cheating - that's scripthook an entirely different program) singleplayer longetivity for this game is basically dead. So ultimately if you're playing with friends and hope to get this at a discount: good luck because it took this game 1 1/2 years before it even seen a 25% discount (and that was with a sharkcard to force it back over $60)! This game is a fun game to play, but it has fallen into a cesspool of gaming because of the lack of caring that Rockstar has towards GTAO since it took them two full years before they even did anything really against modders and they are attacking the wrong party when they finally do make a move.

"Review: Tl;dr - I'm a big fan of From Software and have played DS1, DS2, DS3 and Bloodborne. Let's look past the marketing fluff and the unrealistic 10/10 ratings this game has received before launch. Please remember, this is purely my view and shouldn't in any way influence your decisions. Elden Ring is an awesome game and an amazing experience, albeit it a bit overambitious and just way too long (I’m a completionist). Truly a landmark achievement for From Software. 8/10 would recommend at least one play-through. A masterpiece? It depends... The Good: If you're familiar with previous titles you'll feel right at home. It's textbook From Software and incorporates mechanics from all previous titles. The biggest notable change is in the combat mechanics. Those who dabble in PvP mostly benefit from this change as the build variety is enormous. Graphics are beautiful and the world building is astonishing allowing for a fully immersed experience. You will find yourself pausing often to view many of the world's amazing vistas. Combat feels smooth and intuitive. Despite a ton of new spells & abilities, the character animations are smooth and combat feels very satisfying. The music is epic. It feels very different to previous titles. Not as dark as Dark Souls, however, there were countless moments where the hairs on my neck were standing up. There's nothing better than fighting epic bosses complimented by an epic score. NPC character design is fresh but still in line with what the company is known for. Expect all manner of strange and normal NPC's. This is high fantasy at its best. Day & Night cycles are a great addition to the From Software formula and really brings the world’s atmosphere to life. As a primarily solo player, I was happy to find that I am no longer invaded all the time. Invasions now seem to only happen during cooperative play. Which I'll also cover in ""The Bad"" section of the review. The boss design is great, bar a few... The Bad: The game feels overambitious. The fact that it’s From Software’s first attempt at a massive open world, really shows. You can clearly see that most of the effort went into the first couple of zones as the quality drops when you start noticing the reuse of assets in later zones. Which brings me to my next point. Elden Ring's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. I.e., the massive open world. Because of the sheer size, the game fails to create the intimate and memorable experiences the previous titles created. This is largely due to the fact that the large landmass merely serves as a glue between the more traditional legacy dungeons and unfortunately there's not much between The Lands Between. It feels like butter scraped over too much bread. In typical From Software fashion (much more than in any previous title due to the size), many of the game's assets are repeated, copied, and pasted throughout the world. There's the classic dungeon crawler mix of caves, catacombs, ruins, churches, sewers etc. However, with each iteration they feel less unique and intuitive and this contributed to me feeling burned out after a while. This is not a big living world. Most things are static and will only perform what they’re scripted to do. This was a massive missed opportunity as a world this size could’ve benefited greatly from dynamic events. E.g., you’re walking through a forest at night and suddenly you’re ambushed by bandits or an assassin jumps from a tree to slit your throat. The story is as cryptic as ever. Another missed opportunity granted the fact that George R.R. Martin was involved. Not that it shows, though. In fact, I’m not quite sure what his contributions were other than for marketing purposes. Understand that I love George R.R. Martin’s work but From Software seems more than capable of creating lore-rich worlds as they’ve shown in all their previous titles and the mysterious approach to unraveling the plot is what they’re known for. However, I would’ve preferred with this release, a little more streamlined and traditional story-telling that’s easy to understand and to follow. Invasions (Forced PvP), still happens during cooperative play but not solo play. This was a weird one for me to digest. For some people this is probably fine but for me and my partner, it's frustrating and retracts from the immersion and experience. All I wanted to do is explore The Lands Between with my partner while sipping on some cognac. At least allow players the opportunity to opt-out of PvP. The world is huge, allow us to explore it with our loved ones, uninterrupted. Not optimized for PC and misleading recommended hardware. Everything was fine after I upgraded to an NVMe SSD, 32 gigs of ram, Geforce RTX 3070 Ti OC, and a clean install of Windows 11 Pro with the latest drivers. Keyboard and mouse controls... yeah don't waste your time. A controller is still highly recommended. No ultra-wide screen support and no ability to switch off chromatic aberration, a graphic technology that I’m not a fan of at all. Frames are also locked to 60 fps. Some bosses are clearly designed for cooperative play which might turn away some solo players. And before you think “Git Gud”, I know all about spending weekends learning boss mechanics to topple a challenging foe as I’ve done it countless times in previous titles. Maybe I’m getting old. However, in this game some bosses are just insanely punishing to the point where I felt screw it, I’m going to summon some players to assist. And it felt good. There’s nothing wrong with summoning players for assistance. I’m looking at you, elitists. However, I would've preferred defeating them solo. I just couldn’t be bothered as some boss designs are not solo-friendly. I also urge everyone who has enjoyed Elden Ring, to give the predecessors a go if you haven’t already done so. I myself will definitely be enjoying Dark Souls 1-3 again., Playtime: 261, Voted Up: True, Upvotes: 1, Votes Funny: 0",1
